## Compile your own version from GitHub

GitHub is a source-code hosting service where everyone can contribute to the development of a piece of software.
It stores the current leading state of development of the application.
In some cases, perhaps because you want access to a feature not yet available in the release packages, you may wish to compile your own version from GitHub.

Full instructions are at <https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/blob/master/INSTALL.md>
